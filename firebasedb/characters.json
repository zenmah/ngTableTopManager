        "backstory": "Cathara is a rebellious, stubborn and edgy. She’s careful about how people see her, and hides her true self from a lot of people. You can’t be too careful about your reputation especially here in this community where all that matters is out of which womb you were pooped out of.  So Cathara makes sure that her reputation is what she wants it to be, exactly the opposite of what her father wants her to be. If you look in her eyes closely you can see her judging and calculating.  Cathara still lives with her father, the great “Jean-Claude Monet”. He is a bastard, a demanding, controlling and intoxicated womanizer. If it wasn’t for the fact that most days he leaves her to fend for herself, she might have left years ago. When Cathara was around 5 her mother disappeared or left, with the only thing a hazy memory of her smile and an old amulet..  Just before her Junior year at Cedar “Cheese” Ridge High School started she came across an old chest containing several old looking artifacts and a dusty tome, the Seraphica. Apparently the Tome is written in an old language. Curious she started to read one of the pages out loud, trying to see if there was some meaning to the texts. She felt the amulet growing warm and suddenly she fell into a deep sleep and dreamt that she was looking and feeling like she was someone else.   Cathara is also a bit of a chem-geek, together with her BFF Alice they cook up all kinds of cool experiments. Some of which may or may not have gone as expected.    As a new motivation her father signed her up for music class to improve her ‘lacking’ guitar skills. He even got her the best tutor in town <unknown character>. And he forces her to carry her new guitar ‘A Kitara’  with her at all times. "
